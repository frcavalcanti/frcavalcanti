Full Stack Dev

Fullstack Developer at [PROCERGS](https://www.procergs.rs.gov.br/) coding in Angular / Java - Masters in Innovation, Technology & Sustainability.

Previous experience:  
Software Engineer at [Cloudwalk Inc](https://www.cloudwalk.io) coding in Ruby/RoR / Typescript

My personal values led me to cofound [Exchange do Bem](https://www.exchangedobem.com) where I led teams and groups of volunteers in several countries across the world such as India, South Africa, Thailand and Brazil - in 2022 I left it to pursue a career in tech. 

Ample experience in corporate and multicultural environments, always in search of challenges and with a thirst for knowledge.
